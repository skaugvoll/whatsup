# whatsup
A project to learn Maven, Spring and to catch up on JavaFX.

WhatsUp is a timetable application to create, save and share schedules.
The goal is to help students, families and couples to share their schedules so the other part
knows what the other has planned and can coordinate their own day.


## Essential to work:
### You'll need to create a java class, with the name "_DatabaseConfiguration"
  This will contain all the sensitive information such as database uri, databasename, username, password  (if your using mongod Driver)
  and if you want to use mongolab API, you'll also need collectionName, and apikey
